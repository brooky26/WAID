"""
Config for the live paper-trading pipeline (v1).

Scope, stated up front: this wires Regime -> Probability -> EV -> Risk ->
Opportunity Scoring -> Execution (paper mode) -> Post-Trade together on
live Deriv candles, the live equivalent of what `WalkForwardBacktester`
already does against historical data. Two deliberate simplifications
versus a full live system, both chosen explicitly rather than faked:

1. **In PAPER mode, settlement is next-candle-close direction, not real
   duration_ticks expiry.** This matches the exact label definition the
   probability model is trained on (see backtesting/walk_forward.py's
   `_fit_model` and Stage 5's README recap) and keeps one consistent
   definition of "the real realized outcome" for paper trades, which
   never touch the broker (so this gap has zero effect on capital; it
   only means the *decision* framing is slightly simplified from a
   genuine multi-tick contract). This does NOT apply once execution is
   in LIVE mode: a live buy gets a real `contract_id`, and
   `PaperTradingOrchestrator` polls `ContractOutcomeTracker` for Deriv's
   own real settlement (win/loss/payout on its own duration_ticks clock)
   instead of ever applying this fictional rule to it — see
   `paper_trading/orchestrator.py`'s module docstring.
2. **`assumed_payout_ratio` stands in for a live Deriv proposal.** A real
   proposal (`DerivWebSocketClient.fetch_proposal`) costs nothing and
   touches no money, so wiring it in for realistic live pricing is a
   natural v1.1 improvement — deferred here to keep v1 fully testable
   without a network dependency in the decision loop itself.

Level 7 (RL Trade Management) is deliberately NOT wired into v1: every
paper trade is held to its one-candle settlement rather than managed
with HOLD/SELL decisions. That's a separate, explicitly agreed v2 once
real paper-trading data exists to train the Q-table on.
